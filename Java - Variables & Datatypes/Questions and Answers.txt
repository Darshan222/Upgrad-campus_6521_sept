1. What is a variable in Java?
   Answer: A variable in Java is a named storage location that holds data, which can be of various types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data in a program.

2. How do you declare a variable in Java?
   Answer: To declare a variable in Java, we need to specify the data type followed by the variable name. For example: int number;

3. What are the data types in Java?
   Answer: In Java, data types are used to classify and specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. 
   In Java, data types are classified into two main categories: primitive data types and reference (non-primitive) data types.
   Primitive Data Types: Primitive data types are the basic data types that are predefined in Java. They represent simple values and have fixed sizes in memory.
   There are eight primitive data types in Java: int, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long, and float.
   Non-Primitive Data Types: Reference data types, also known as non-primitive data types, are data types that do not directly store the data but instead store references (memory addresses) to objects or instances of classes.
   Reference data types include classes, Strings, interfaces, arrays, and user-defined types.

4. How do you initialise a variable in Java?
   Answer: We can initialize a variable when you declare it by assigning it a value. For example: int count = 10;

5. What is the default size and range of primitive data types?
   Answer: byte: Default size: 8 bits (1 byte), Range: -128 to 127
           short: Default size: 16 bits (2 bytes), Range: -32,768 to 32,767
           int: Default size: 32 bits (4 bytes), Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
           long: Default size: 64 bits (8 bytes), Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
           float: Default size: 32 bits (4 bytes), Range: 7 decimal digits of precision
           double: Default size: 64 bits (8 bytes), Range: 15 decimal digits of precision
           char: Default size: 16 bits (2 bytes), Represents a single Unicode character
           boolean: Default size: 1 bit, Represents true or false values

6. Write a Java program to calculate the area of a rectangle. Declare two integer variables length and width, and calculate the area by multiplying them.
   Answer:
   public class RectangleArea {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        int length = 5;
        int width = 3;
        int area = length * width;
        System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + area);
      }
    }
7. Write a Java program to calculate the average of three decimal numbers. Declare three double variables and calculate the average.
   Answer:
   public class AverageCalculator {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        double num1 = 4.5;
        double num2 = 6.2;
        double num3 = 7.8;
        double average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
      }
    }
8. Write a Java program to concatenate two strings and store the result in a new variable fullName.
   Answer:
   public class StringConcatenation {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        String firstName = "John";
        String lastName = "Doe";
        String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
        System.out.println("Full Name: " + fullName);
      }
    }
9. Write a Java program to swap the values of two integer variables x and y without using a third variable.
   Answer:
   public class SwapVariables {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int y = 10;
        x = x + y;
        y = x - y;
        x = x - y;
        System.out.println("After swapping: x = " + x + ", y = " + y);
      }
    }
10. Write a Java program that converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius. Prompt the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit and display the equivalent temperature in Celsius.
    Answer:
    import java.util.Scanner;
    public class FahrenheitToCelsius {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
        double fahrenheit = scanner.nextDouble();
        double celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9;
        System.out.println("Temperature in Celsius: " + celsius);
        scanner.close();
      }
    }
